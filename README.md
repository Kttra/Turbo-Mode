# Turbo Mode
A gpc script made to repeatedly press a controller button for you. This is also known as the "turbo mode" feature found in custom controllers or arcade sticks. It is generally used so that you do not wear down your controller too quickly by rapidly pressing down on the buttons. There are two versions of this script and they both have different activation steps. The difference are as follows:

**Version 3.5 (For older gen controllers without a share button)**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To activate the script, press the select button twice quickly. Then press twice on the button you want turbo mode to be on. This 
script also has a hold button feature that can be toggled between by hitting down on the d-pad twice. More details in the script itself. This script will be labeled spam script from now on.

**Version 4.5 (Better version, for newer controllers with a share button):**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To activate, press the share button. I have made it so the share button will not screenshot or take a video. After activating, the TitanTwo will glow red. This means turbo mode is on. You can now press on any button to activate turbo mode besides the buttons on the d-pad. Pressing down twice on the d-pad will activate hold mode instead (TitanTwo will glow orange). Pressing the share button again will deactivate the script (TitanTwo will glow blue now). This script will be labeled turbo mode.

**Turbo Mode in Action**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the video below, the script it started by pressing the share button. Notice that on the output side, share is not outputted as to prevent accidental screenshots. Then when "a" button is pressed, the output side repeatedly shows "a" being quickly tapped down on without user input. Finally "a" is pressed again to stop the output. This is repeated with the "x" button. Then the rest of the supported buttons are shown. Pressing share button again disables and resets the script.
