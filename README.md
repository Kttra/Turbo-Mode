# Turbo Mode
Script made to repeatedly press a button for you. This is also known as the "turbo mode" feature found in custom controllers or arcade sticks. It is generally used so that you do not wear down your controller too quickly by rapidly pressing down on the buttons. There are two versions of this script. The difference are as follows:

**Version 3.5 (For older gen controllers without a share button)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To activate the script, press the select button twice quickly. Then press twice on the button you want turbo mode to be on. This 
script also &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has a hold button feature that can be toggled between by hitting down on the d-pad twice. More details in the script itself. This script will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be labeled spam script from now on.

**Version 4.5 (Better version, for newer controllers with a share button):**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To activate, press the share button. I have made it so the share button will not screenshot or take a video. After activating, the TitanTwo will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glow red. This means turbo mode is on. You can now press on any button to activate turbo mode besides the buttons on the d-pad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressing down on the d-pad will activate hold mode instead (TitanTwo will glow orange). Pressing the share button again will deactivate the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;script (TitanTwo will glow blue now). This script will be labeled turbo mode.
